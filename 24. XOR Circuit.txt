#24: Write a logical expression that is equivalent to the Exclusive OR gate on 2 inputs, #called in1, in2:

#If either one or the other (but not both) input is True, then your expression should #evaluate to True.
#Otherwise (both inputs are True or both inputs are False), then your expression should #evaluate to False.

out = (not in1 and in2) or (in1 and not in2)
